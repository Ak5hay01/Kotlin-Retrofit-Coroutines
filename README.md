# Kotlin-Retrofit-Coroutines


This is a repository with simple Retrofit and coroutines implementation. I have tried to make it more simple by just downloading an image from internet and showing it in the imageview. I have used MVVM architecture for getting data using viewModelScope. I have also tried to add small example of how to send data from 1 activity to another using intent.
